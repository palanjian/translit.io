# translit.live 🌐

### [translit.live](https://www.translit.live) is an context-sensitive tool for transliterating foreign text from its native script to Latin characters.

## Features 📚
* **Contextual Transliteration:** translit.live is the **only** platform to utilize context to transliterate in contemporary conversational Armenian, rather than academic Romanization.
*  **Dialect Selection:** The web app supports both the Eastern and Western Armenian dialects. 
* **Variation Customization:** Allows users to choose from various common transliteration variations for specific letters, tailoring the output to their preferences. Cookies are utilized to store these user preferences for the next time they visit.
* **Responsive Design:** The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

#### Sample Text
```
Armenian National Anthem
Մեր Հայրենիք, ազատ, անկախ,
Որ ապրել է դարեդար,
Յուր որդիքը արդ կանչում է
Ազատ, անկախ Հայաստան։
```
## Roadmap 🗺️
The next step for translit.live is refactoring the project to be as agnostic as possible. This way, we can open the project for contribution from others and create an efficient system of adding more languages & dialects.
#### Additional Objectives  
* Backwards Compatibility (Ex. English → Armenian)
* Chrome Extension
